# Chapter 1: Introduction
In today's fast-paced technological landscape, the ability to access and understand software projects is more critical than ever.
As open-source software continues to gain traction, fostering a rich ecosystem where developers can contribute, collaborate, and innovate is paramount.
This project aims to address the existing challenges in software project documentation and facilitate greater engagement from both hobbyists and professional developers.

### Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop a two-part solution that includes a web-based interface and a desktop application.
The web part will serve as an index for all software projects and their accompanying Doxygen documentation, providing users with a centralized location to access vital information.
The desktop application will empower administrators to manage project documentation efficiently, ensuring that all resources are up-to-date and easily accessible.

### Importance of Software Documentation
Documentation plays a crucial role in the software development lifecycle. 
It serves as a guide for developers, helping them understand the code structure, functionality, and intended use of software projects.
However, many open-source projects suffer from inadequate documentation, which can discourage potential contributors and lead to frustration among users.
By improving the documentation process, we aim to create an environment where developers can quickly find the information they need, 
thereby enhancing their overall experience.

### Target Audience
This project is designed to cater to a diverse audience, including:

**Hobbyists:** Individuals who are passionate about coding and eager to learn.
They may seek projects to contribute to, improve their skills, and engage with the developer community.

**Professional Developers:** Experienced individuals looking for opportunities to collaborate on open-source projects, share their expertise, and enhance their portfolios.

By addressing the needs of both groups, we hope to create a welcoming space that encourages participation and collaboration.

### Goals and Objectives
The goals of this project are as follows:

**Centralized Access:** Develop a web part that indexes all software projects and their documentation, making it easier for users to find relevant information quickly.

**Administrative Tools:** Create a desktop application that facilitates the management of project documentation, ensuring that it remains current and comprehensive.

**Community Engagement:** Foster a vibrant community of developers who are motivated to contribute code and documentation, increasing the visibility and viability of our open-source projects.

**Enhanced User Experience:** Design an intuitive user interface that allows users to navigate easily and find the information they need without unnecessary complexity.

### Conclusion
As we embark on this project, we are committed to creating a solution that not only addresses the challenges of software documentation but also cultivates a community of engaged developers. 
In the following chapters, we will explore the problems we aim to solve, the wishes for our project, and the methodologies we will employ to achieve our objectives. 
Together, we can build a platform that empowers developers and enhances the overall quality of open-source software documentation.

# Chapter 2: Problem Statement

## Summary
Organizations host many repositories with uneven, scattered documentation. Doxygen outputs exist but are hard to discover, keep fresh, and navigate. There is no single place to index projects, render docs consistently, or measure doc quality and usage. Admin workflows to register projects, schedule crawls, and monitor failures are manual and error‑prone.

## Symptoms and Pain Points
- Discoverability
  - No central index of projects and docs; users rely on ad‑hoc links.
  - Missing cross‑project and symbol‑level search with filters.
- Documentation quality and freshness
  - Stale docs, broken internal links, and unstable permalinks across releases.
  - Incomplete metadata (owner, license, tags) reduces trust and reusability.
- Admin workflows and observability
  - Manual uploads and rebuilds; no reliable scheduling or status visibility.
  - Weak alerting for failed crawls and limited error logs.
- Integrations
  - Inconsistent sync with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket; slow updates from source events.
- Community and contribution
  - Few mechanisms to suggest improvements; weak linkage to issues/PRs.
- Security and compliance
  - Inconsistent role‑based access for admin features; secrets management varies by team.

## Problem Statements (persona‑centric)
- As a developer, I cannot find relevant classes/functions across projects, causing wasted time and duplicate work.
- As a new contributor, I cannot judge project quality because metadata and docs are missing or outdated, reducing my motivation to contribute.
- As an administrator, I cannot reliably schedule or monitor documentation crawls, increasing MTTR when failures occur.
- As a tech writer, I cannot verify link integrity and permalink stability across releases, leading to broken references.
- As an API consumer, I cannot depend on stable URLs to deep‑link into docs from external systems, breaking integrations.
- As a security owner, I cannot enforce RBAC and secret storage standards across admin operations, increasing risk.

## Business and Technical Impact
- Longer onboarding and slower delivery due to poor discoverability and stale docs.
- Lower community engagement and fewer contributions.
- Operational toil for admins; delayed detection and resolution of failures.
- Compliance and security risks from inconsistent controls.

## Root Causes (hypotheses)
- No centralized, searchable index for projects and Doxygen artifacts.
- Lack of automated pipelines for crawl/build/upload and metadata validation.
- Unstructured or incomplete metadata; weak schema enforcement.
- Missing or under‑tuned search engine and relevance signals.
- Limited monitoring, alerting, and logs for indexing/crawl jobs.

## Scope and Out of Scope
- In scope
  - Web UI to index, search, and render Doxygen docs with stable links and navigation.
  - Desktop admin app (or CLI) for registration, scheduling, status, and uploads.
  - Integrations with major VCS hosts for metadata and event‑driven updates.
  - KPIs and reporting for search, freshness, quality, adoption, and ops.
- Out of scope (initially)
  - Automatic conversion of non‑Doxygen formats.
  - Advanced editorial workflows beyond submissions/links to external issue trackers.

## Constraints and Assumptions
- Technology: .NET 9, Blazor WebAssembly for the web UI; cross‑platform desktop app.
- Inputs: Doxygen‑generated HTML/JSON as primary documentation artifacts.
- Platform: Linux/containerized backend, MSSQL, and scalable search engine.
- Privacy/compliance: Role‑based access for admin features; encrypted storage for secrets.

## Success Criteria (linked to KPIs)
- Discoverability: High search success and low query latency (see FR‑002/FR‑016, NFR‑001).
- Freshness and quality: High index freshness, low broken link rate, stable permalinks (FR‑001/FR‑004).
- Admin efficiency: Reliable on‑time schedules, low MTTR, prompt alerts (FR‑007/FR‑008/FR‑017).
- Adoption and engagement: Growth in indexed projects, MAU, and contributions (KPIs — Adoption & Community).
- Security and compliance: 100% RBAC test pass, secrets encrypted at rest, zero critical vulns beyond SLA (NFR‑006/007/008).
